# Weak Convergence and Lévy's Continuity Theorem

This file proves Lévy's continuity theorem: a sequence of probability measures
on ℝ converges weakly if and only if their characteristic functions converge
pointwise.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.CharFunTendsto` — pointwise convergence of
  characteristic functions along a filter.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.charFunTendsto_of_tendsto` — weak convergence
  implies pointwise convergence of characteristic functions.
* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.isTight_of_charFunTendsto` — pointwise convergence
  of characteristic functions implies tightness of the sequence.
* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.tendsto_of_charFunTendsto` — pointwise convergence
  of characteristic functions implies weak convergence (Lévy's continuity theorem).
* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.tendsto_iff_charFunTendsto` — the biconditional.

/-- Auxiliary: for any δ > 0, there exist r > 0 and n₀ such that for all n ≥ n₀,
the tail measure (μs n){x | r < |x|} is at most δ.

This follows from:
1. `measureReal_abs_gt_le_integral_charFun`: tail ≤ (1/2) r ‖∫ t in (-2/r)..(2/r), 1 - charFun‖
2. Continuity of charFun μ at 0 (so the integral for μ is small for small intervals)
3. Dominated convergence: the integrals for μₙ converge to those for μ

/-- **Tightness from characteristic function convergence.** If the characteristic
functions of a sequence of probability measures converge pointwise to the
characteristic function of a probability measure μ, then the sequence is tight.

The proof uses the tail bound `measureReal_abs_gt_le_integral_charFun` together
with dominated convergence for the integral of `1 - charFun` over symmetric intervals.
For n ≥ n₀ the tail bound gives uniform control; for the finitely many n < n₀,
each probability measure on ℝ (a Polish space) is individually tight. -/

Proof outline:
1. By `isTight_of_charFunTendsto`, the sequence is tight.
2. By Prokhorov's theorem (tight ⇒ relatively compact), every subsequence has a
   further weakly convergent subsequence.
3. By the easy direction + charfun injectivity (`Measure.ext_of_charFun`), all
   subsequential limits equal μ.
4. By `tendsto_of_subseq_tendsto`, the full sequence converges. -/
