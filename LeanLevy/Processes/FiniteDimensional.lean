# Finite-Dimensional Distributions

This file defines the finite-dimensional distributions of a stochastic process
indexed by `ℝ≥0` with values in a measurable space `E`.

Given a process `X : ℝ≥0 → Ω → E` and a probability measure `μ` on `Ω`,
the **finite-dimensional distribution** at times `I : Finset ℝ≥0` is the
pushforward measure on `(i : I) → E` capturing the joint law of
`(X t₁, …, X tₙ)`.

## Main definitions

* `ProbabilityTheory.finiteDimMap X I` — the sampling map `ω ↦ (i ↦ X i ω)`.
* `ProbabilityTheory.finiteDimDistribution X μ I` — the joint law at times `I`.

## Main results

* `ProbabilityTheory.measurable_finiteDimMap` — the sampling map is measurable.
* `ProbabilityTheory.finiteDimDistribution_restrict` — marginalizing from `I` to
  `J ⊆ I` gives the distribution at `J`.
* `ProbabilityTheory.isProjectiveMeasureFamily_finiteDimDistribution` — the family
  of finite-dimensional distributions is projective.
* `ProbabilityTheory.isProbabilityMeasure_finiteDimDistribution` — probability in,
  probability out.

/-- The finite-dimensional distributions of a measurable process form a
projective measure family: marginalizing from a larger time set to a smaller
subset always recovers the distribution at the smaller set.

This connects the process to mathlib's projective limit machinery
(`IsProjectiveMeasureFamily`), which is the key ingredient for the
Kolmogorov extension theorem. -/
