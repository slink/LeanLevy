# Càdlàg Functions

A function is **càdlàg** (continue à droite, limite à gauche) if it is right-continuous
and has left limits at every point. This is the standard regularity condition for sample
paths of Lévy processes and many other stochastic processes.

## Main definitions

* `ProbabilityTheory.IsCadlagAt f t` — `f` is right-continuous at `t` and has a left limit at `t`.
* `ProbabilityTheory.IsCadlag f` — `f` is càdlàg everywhere.

## Main results

* `ProbabilityTheory.isCadlag_const` — constant functions are càdlàg.
* `Monotone.leftLim_exists_nat` — a monotone function `f : ℝ≥0 → ℕ` has left limits.
* `Monotone.isCadlag_of_rightContinuous_nat` — a monotone, right-continuous, ℕ-valued function
  is càdlàg.

/-! ### Monotone ℕ-valued functions on ℝ≥0

A monotone function `f : ℝ≥0 → ℕ` has left limits at every point. The key observation is
that the image of `Iio t` under `f` is a bounded (by `f t`) subset of `ℕ`, hence finite.
A finite nonempty subset of `ℕ` has a maximum, and by monotonicity `f` is eventually
constant near `t` from the left. -/

/-- A monotone function `f : ℝ≥0 → ℕ` has a left limit at every point.

At `t = 0`, the set `Iio 0` is empty in `ℝ≥0`, so the filter `𝓝[Iio 0] 0 = ⊥` and any
value works. At `t > 0`, the image `f '' Iio t` is a nonempty bounded subset of `ℕ`,
hence has a maximum achieved at some `s₀ < t`. By monotonicity, `f` is constantly equal
to this maximum on `(s₀, t)`, which is a neighborhood of `t` in `𝓝[<] t`. -/
