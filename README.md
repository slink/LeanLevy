# LeanLevy

A Lean 4 formalization of Lévy processes, built on top of mathlib.

## What's here

**Bochner API** (`LeanLevy/Representation/BochnerGaussian.lean`)
- `covMatrix`: covariance matrix `ψ(tᵢ - tⱼ)` of a positive definite function, with `covMatrix_is_psd`
- `bochner_identity`: for continuous PD ψ with ψ(0)=1, `ψ t = ∫ exp(I·t·x) ∂μ` for the spectral measure μ (explicit-integral form of Bochner's theorem)

**Fourier analysis** (`LeanLevy/Fourier/`)
- Fourier transform of finite measures on ℝ, with boundedness, continuity, and value at zero
- Positive definite functions: definition, Schur product theorem, pointwise closure, characteristic function bridge
- Bochner's theorem, proved via Gaussian smoothing, Prokhorov compactness, and Lévy continuity

**Characteristic functions** (`LeanLevy/Probability/Characteristic.lean`)
- Characteristic function of probability measures
- Bochner positive semi-definiteness
- Multiplicativity under convolution

**Poisson distribution** (`LeanLevy/Probability/Poisson.lean`)
- Expectation, variance, second factorial moment
- Characteristic function: `φ(ξ) = exp(r(exp(iξ) − 1))`

**Lévy's continuity theorem** (`LeanLevy/Probability/WeakConvergence.lean`)
- Weak convergence of probability measures is equivalent to pointwise convergence of characteristic functions
- Tightness from convergence of characteristic functions

**Stochastic processes** (`LeanLevy/Processes/StochasticProcess.lean`)
- Independent and stationary increments
- Increment independence from the natural filtration

**Finite-dimensional distributions** (`LeanLevy/Processes/FiniteDimensional.lean`)
- Joint law at finitely many times as a pushforward measure
- Marginalization: restricting to a subset of times recovers the sub-distribution
- Projective consistency (`IsProjectiveMeasureFamily`)

**Projective families** (`LeanLevy/Processes/ProjectiveFamily.lean`)
- Bundled structure: measure family + consistency + probability
- Projection and composition lemmas (functoriality)
- Constructor from stochastic processes

**Càdlàg paths** (`LeanLevy/Processes/Cadlag.lean`)
- Right-continuity with left limits
- Monotone ℕ-valued functions are càdlàg when right-continuous

**Lévy processes** (`LeanLevy/Processes/LevyProcess.lean`)
- Definition: independent increments, stationary increments, càdlàg paths, starts at zero
- Characteristic exponent and supporting lemmas (multiplicativity, non-vanishing, right-continuity)

**Kolmogorov extension theorem** (`LeanLevy/Processes/Kolmogorov.lean`)
- Existence and uniqueness of the projective limit measure on Polish spaces
- σ-additivity of the cylinder content via inner regularity and Tychonoff compactness

**Poisson process** (`LeanLevy/Processes/PoissonProcess.lean`)
- Defined as a counting process with independent, Poisson-distributed increments
- Constructed via the Kolmogorov extension theorem from its finite-dimensional distributions, whose projective consistency comes down to the convolution identity for Poisson laws
- Is a Lévy process

**Characteristic exponent** (`LeanLevy/Levy/CharacteristicExponent.lean`)
- Local log construction (branch-cut safe) and local-global exponent agreement
- Semigroup API: multiplicativity, power formulas, complex power law `φ_t(ξ) = φ₁(ξ)^t`
- Ceiling-sequence density lemma: right-continuous + continuous functions agreeing on ℕ/ℕ rationals are equal
- Lévy exponential formula `F(t,ξ) = exp(tΨ(ξ))` with full continuity in `t`

**Infinite divisibility** (`LeanLevy/Levy/InfiniteDivisible.lean`)
- Iterated convolution, with characteristic function formula
- Poisson distribution is infinitely divisible
- Lévy process marginals are infinitely divisible

**Lévy measures** (`LeanLevy/Levy/LevyMeasure.lean`)
- `IsLevyMeasure` predicate: `ν({0}) = 0` and `∫ min(1, x²) dν < ∞`
- Finite mass on `{x | ε ≤ |x|}`, σ-finiteness

**Compensated integrand** (`LeanLevy/Levy/CompensatedIntegral.lean`)
- `levyCompensatedIntegrand ξ x = exp(ixξ) − 1 − ixξ·1_{|x|<1}`
- Pointwise norm bound, measurability, Bochner integrability under a Lévy measure

**Lévy–Khintchine theorem** (`LeanLevy/Levy/LevyKhintchine.lean`, `LevyKhintchineProof.lean`, `LevyKhintchineUniqueness.lean`)
- `LevyKhintchineTriple`: a drift, a Gaussian variance, and a Lévy measure, whose `exponent` is the Lévy–Khintchine formula `ψ_T(ξ) = ibξ − σ²ξ²/2 + ∫ (e^{ixξ} − 1 − ixξ·1_{|x|<1}) dν`
- `levyKhintchine_representation`: every infinitely divisible probability measure on ℝ has characteristic function `exp(ψ_T)` for some triple. The Lévy measure is only required to be σ-finite with `∫ min(1,x²) dν < ∞`, so infinite-activity cases such as α-stable laws are covered (their infinite divisibility is not itself formalized here)
- The proof extracts Khintchine's canonical measure by a single Prokhorov argument applied to the `min(1,x²)`-tilted scaled measures, untilts it into the Lévy measure, and obtains the whole triple along one subsequence. The limit is identified at a split radius `r ∈ (1/2, 1]` chosen so that `ν` has no atom on the sphere; the resulting variance `σ² = lim t⁻¹∫_{|x|<r} x² dμ_t − ∫_{|x|<r} x² dν` keeps the small-jump second moment from being counted both in `σ²` and in the compensated integral
- `levyKhintchine_converse`: conversely, every triple is realised by an infinitely divisible law — `ψ_T` is continuous, vanishes at `0`, is Hermitian and conditionally negative definite, so Schoenberg's theorem and Bochner's theorem produce a convolution semigroup whose time-`1` member has characteristic function `exp(ψ_T)`
- `LevyKhintchineTriple.ext_of_exponent_eq`: the triple is determined by its exponent, via Sato's smearing argument — `ψ_T(ξ) − ½∫_{[-1,1]} ψ_T(ξ+u) du` is the characteristic function of a finite measure with a `σ²/6` atom at the origin and density `1 − sinc` against `ν`, from which `σ²`, `ν`, and then the drift are recovered
- `isInfinitelyDivisible_iff_exists_levyKhintchineTriple` and `existsUnique_levyKhintchineTriple`: a probability measure on ℝ is infinitely divisible iff its characteristic function is `exp(ψ_T)` for a triple `T`, and that triple is unique (equal exponentials force equal exponents by a continuous-logarithm argument on the connected line)

**Compound Poisson process** (`LeanLevy/Processes/CompoundPoisson.lean`, `CompoundPoissonLaw.lean`)
- **Construction**: `exists_isCompoundPoissonDriver` — for any rate `r > 0` and jump law `ν'`, a driver `(τ, Y)` of i.i.d. exponential interarrival times and i.i.d. `ν'`-marks, jointly independent, on a canonical product space
- **Sample paths**: `compoundPoisson_ae_isCadlag` — the path `t ↦ b·t + ∑_{n ≤ N(t)} Yₙ` is almost surely càdlàg
- **Pathwise Itô formula**: `compoundPoisson_pathwise_ito` — for a `C¹` function `f`, a purely *pathwise* change-of-variables identity `f(Xₜ) − f(X₀) = ∫₀ᵗ f'(Xₛ)·b ds + ∑ jump terms`, valid for these finite-activity paths with no stochastic integral (the drift part is an ordinary Riemann integral, the jumps a finite sum)
- **Jump-count law**: `map_jumpCount_arrival` — the number of jumps by time `t` is Poisson with mean `r·t`, obtained from the Gamma law of the arrival times and telescoping survival probabilities
- **Characteristic function**: `charFun_map_compoundPoisson` — the marginal at time `t` has characteristic function `exp(t·(i b ξ + r·(charFun ν' ξ − 1)))`, by conditioning on the Poisson jump count and summing the generating series
- **Lévy–Khintchine realization**: `compoundPoissonTriple` is the triple `(b + ∫_{|x|<1} x d(r·ν'), 0, r·ν')`; `charFun_map_compoundPoisson_eq_exponent` shows the marginal's characteristic function is `exp(t·ψ_T)` for this triple, so compound Poisson processes realize exactly the finite-activity, zero-Gaussian Lévy–Khintchine triples, and `isInfinitelyDivisible_map_compoundPoisson` records that every marginal is infinitely divisible (via the converse Lévy–Khintchine theorem)

**Poisson random measures** (`LeanLevy/RandomMeasure/PoissonPointFamily.lean`, `PoissonRandomMeasure.lean`, `PoissonCompensated.lean`)

For a σ-finite intensity measure `m` on a measurable space, the random measure is constructed, rather than axiomatized.
- **Point family**: `prmPiece`, `prmPieceLaw` partition the space into disjoint finite-mass pieces and normalize `m` on each; `IsPoissonPointFamily` bundles a family of piece counts and points, and `exists_isPoissonPointFamily` builds it in one shot with the counts and all points jointly independent, each count Poisson-distributed with the piece mass and each point drawn from the normalized piece law
- **Per-piece identities**: `integral_pieceSum` is Campbell's formula for a piece (`E[∑ g(Xₙ)] = ∫ g dm`), `integral_sq_pieceSum` its second moment, and `integral_pieceProd_eq_exp` the piece probability-generating-function identity `E[∏ w(Xₙ)] = exp(m(piece)·(∫ w dm̂ − 1))`
- **Thinning**: `thinnedCount` counts the points of a piece landing in a set; `map_thinnedCount` shows this count is Poisson with mean `m(piece ∩ A)`, and `indepFun_thinnedCount_thinnedCount` gives pairwise independence of the counts on disjoint sets
- **The random measure**: `poissonRandomMeasure` is a genuine `Measure`-valued random object, a countable sum of Dirac masses at the realized points, with `poissonRandomMeasure_apply` its evaluation and `measurable_poissonRandomMeasure_apply` measurability; `map_poissonRandomMeasure_apply` is the superposition law — the count `N(A)` on a finite-mass set is Poisson with mean `m A` — and `indepFun_poissonRandomMeasure_apply` gives pairwise independence of the evaluations on disjoint sets (mutual independence of a finite family of disjoint-set evaluations is not yet formalized)
- **Compensated integral**: `compensatedPoissonSum` is the centered sum `∑ f(Xₙ) − ∫ f dm`; `integral_compensatedPoissonSum` shows it has mean zero and `integral_sq_compensatedPoissonSum` is Campbell's second formula, the L² isometry `E[Ñ(f)²] = ∫ f² dm` on `L¹ ∩ L²`, with `memLp_two_compensatedPoissonSum` recording square-integrability; `compensatedPoissonIntegral : Lp ℝ 2 m → Lp ℝ 2 μ` extends the map to all of `L²(m)` by density, `eLpNorm_compensatedPoissonIntegral` being the isometry on the whole space and `compensatedPoissonIntegral_eq_sum` its agreement with the explicit sum on `L¹ ∩ L²`

The codebase is sorry-free. `#print axioms` on the main results — the Lévy–Khintchine representation, converse, uniqueness, and characterization, the compound Poisson pathwise Itô formula and law identification, and the Poisson random measure superposition law, disjoint-set independence, compensated second-moment isometry, and its L² extension — reports only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
